        ended 
        when playback or streaming has stopped because the end of the media was reached or because no further data is available. This event occurs based upon HTMLMediaElement (<audio> and <video>) fire ended when playback of the media reaches the end of the media.

        pause 
        when a request to pause an activity is handled and the activity has entered its paused state, most commonly after the media has been paused through a call to the element's pause() method.

        play 
        when the paused property is changed from true to false, as a result of the play method, or the autoplay attribute.

        playing 
        after playback is first started, and whenever it is restarted. For example it is fired when playback resumes after having been paused or delayed due to lack of data.
